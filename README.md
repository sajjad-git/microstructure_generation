# microstructure_generation
This repo showcases my attempts at generating inorganic chemical composite images.

The aim of this project is to understand the hidden characteristics of chemical composites structures and create different versions of them. Additionally, the project seeks to blend these structures together to form new ones that possess specific physical and chemical properties desired by the researchers.
